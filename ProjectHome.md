X-Plane Interface (X-Pi) is a simple and easy to use Java library that interfaces your
code with the X-Plane flight simulator.

It uses only UDP packets to communicate with X-Plane, and, thus, is independent of the X-Plane SDK.

Being written in Java, this framework can be used in any environment that uses
the JVM, including, but not limited to, Matlab, Jython, and Groovy.

The main purpose behind X-PI's development was to enable researchers with a
tool to easily access and control a sophisticated flight simulator. Some uses
for the library include Hardware-In-The\_Loop development, Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles control, mission planning, etc.
