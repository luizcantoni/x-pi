X-Plane Interface (X-Pi) is a simple and easy to use Java library that interfaces your code with the X-Plane flight simulator.

It uses only UDP packets to communicate with X-Plane, and, thus, is independent of the X-Plane SDK.

Being written in Java, this framework can be used in any environment that uses the JVM, including, but not limited to, Matlab, Jython, and Groovy.

The main purpose behind X-PI's development was to enable researchers with a tool to easily access and control a sophisticated flight simulator. Some uses for the library include Hardware-In-The_Loop? development, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles control, mission planning, etc.

I implemented this library for my Master Thesis (2008-2010), since then I haven't used it anymore. If you have some doubt or sugestion, please contact me.
